# Symmetrical spoon

Symmetrical spoon is an application which encourages users to explore their nearby areas and
complete various tasks to receive ingame rewards. It follows the MVVM design pattern.

## Getting started

The application will work just by downloading or cloning the repository, there are no APIs used
which would require any API key setup.

## Features

* #### Interactive map which displays randomly generated locations within 5km radius with latitude/longitude values that have various tasks generated within them.
    * Upon reaching the location physically, users are given the possibility to enter AR (Augmented
      Reality) mode to start the task that has been generated for this location.
    * Tasks can include 4 different kinds of objectives to complete:
        1. **Normal quiz**, where user is required to answer correctly to a simple multiple choice
           question
        2. **Image quiz**, where the user is required to recognize the image they are presented
        3. **Find the correct image**, where the user is presented multiple images around them and
           they have to find the matching image to the task description
        4. **Find the spheres**, where there are randomly generated 3D spheres around the user which
           user has to collect
    * Upon completing this task the user is rewarded with the currency that was generated for the
      location.

* #### There is a reward shop in the application which users are able to browse and spend in-game currency at
    * Rewards are 3D models that users are able to play with in an always available AR session that
      is available once user has atleast one reward purchased
    * All of the rewards are bought with the currecies that are generated for completing the AR
      tasks mentioned above
    * The amount of currencies required vary between the purchasable objects, the more interesting
      rewards are more expensive whereas the cheap rewards might not be so interesting
    * Some of the rewards are animated and might have sound included in them as well
* #### Graphs
    * Graphs are used to display users activity by displaying how much of the different currencies
      they have collected
    * The activity level is displayed with a simple barchart
* #### Daily quests
    * Daily quests are tasks that are generated once per day to offer a special task to user to gain
      some of the rarer currencies
* #### Step counter
    * Feature that allows users to track their daily step count as they would ideally complete the
      AR tasks by walking to the locations

## Data persistence

The application uses Room SQLite database for data persistence. Included tables are:

1. **Mapdetails table** for storing single day entries, including collected currency amounts
2. **Latitude/Longitude table** for storing single latitude/longitude values with associated rewards
   and gametypes. Contains foreign key to Mapdetails table, a single day can have 15 lat/lng entries
3. **Inventory table** table which is used to save all currency values
4. **CollectedItem table** table which contains the information of the rewards bought from the
   in-game shop
5. **DailyQuest table** for storing the daily quest associated with a single day. Contains foreign
   key to Mapdetails table

## Web services

The application uses an API called [ *Open Trivia Database*](https://opentdb.com/), the API doesn't
require any API key for usage. This API is used to generate the content for normal quizzes.

Content for *Image quiz*, *Find the correct image task* and *Rewards displayed in the reward shop*
are acquired from single .json files by fetching them from a webdisk
using [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/).

The application doesn't have any backend service connected to it, but simple modifications on the
aforementioned json files allow for some simple modifications and additions to content without
requiring updating from the client side.

## Map

A library called [Osmdroid](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid) is used for creating the map in
the app's mapview, it's also responsible for drawing markers and polygons in the map and measuring
the distance between user and selected marker.

User's current location is received
from [fused location provider](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/FusedLocationProviderClient.html)
, which is provided by the Google Location Services API, part of Google Play Services, which
provides a more powerful, high-level framework that automates tasks such as location provider choice
and power management.

## Game AR

Augmented Reality is provided by [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar) which is Googleâ€™s
platform for building augmented reality experiences. Using different APIs, ARCore enables the phone
to sense its environment, understand the world and interact with information.

The scene graph API used to create the virtual objects is called Sceneform, it's responsible for
displaying the simple widgets, images and 3D objects that appear in the AR fragment of the
application. Sceneform was deprecated and open sourced by Google a few years ago but this
application uses a [fork](https://thomasgorisse.github.io/sceneform-android-sdk/) which is
maintained by community.
